##MadOwl
MadOwl is a hands on lab management environment. It helps presenters to monitor the progress of the delegates in their current session. More advanced features will allow delegates to chat with each other, post direct questions to the presenter and report issues with the lab.

**Note:** The service is built ontop of Azure Service Fabric.
